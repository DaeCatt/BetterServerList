# Dae's Better Server List

Dae's Better Server List improves the experience of connecting to a dedicated
server in Terraria and hides IPs and passwords by default.

The 10 recent servers list is upgrade to allow you to favorite entries, delete
entries and edit a server's name, ip, and port. Server passwords can be
remembered to make joining a secure server much faster.

-   This mod does not provide a Server Browser! This feature _may_ be provided in
    a future update depending on time and interest.
-   Join via Steam is currently untested but _should_ work.
-   This mod is entirely client side and does not need to be running on the
    server.
